# Playlist Manager

A Java-based playlist management system that uses data structures to store, search, and manage songs.  
This project was implemented as part of a Data Structures course and demonstrates the practical use of ArrayLists, Linked Lists, and Queues, along with JUnit testing and object-oriented design.

# Features

- Add, remove, and update songs in a playlist  
- Two playlist implementations:
  - `PlaylistArrayList` – Made using an array list  
  - `PlaylistLinkedList` – Made using a linked list  
- `RecentlyPlayedQueue` to track the most recently played songs  
- Search for songs by title, artist, and other fields  
- Insert a song at a specific index in the playlist  
- JUnit tests for core operations (add, remove, insert, search, queue behavior)

# Skills Demonstrated

- Custom data structures (ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue)  
- Object-oriented programming (classes, methods, encapsulation)  
- Indexed insertion, removal, and traversal algorithms  
- JUnit testing for playlist and queue operations
